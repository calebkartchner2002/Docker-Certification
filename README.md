# Docker Certification Course

My docker account: https://hub.docker.com/repositories/calebkartchner2002

## Organization of Project
1. assignments that work and build from will be under `caleb-assignments` in their respective folder
2. My Udemy course is split into 29 sections which I will record notes on each section in `udemy-section-notes`
3. notes made before section 6 are stored in `early_week_transfered_notes.md`, this is a less organized notes page transfered from google docs.
